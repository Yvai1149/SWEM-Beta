*Note: Do NOT contact a a volunteer directly related to bugs*   

Issue tracking will be handled via this Github repo. You will need to create a Github account in order to submit issues.  

At the top of the page is a tab labeled `Issues`. This will be the primary location to submit any and all bug reports. You can see the current bugs being tracked and via a green button at the top right that says `New Issue`, you can create a new issue. **prior to submitting a bug report, please make sure there is not an existing bug report that already details your problem**.
