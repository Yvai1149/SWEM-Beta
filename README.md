### Submitting a bug report

To submit a bug report you can do so two different ways   

**1. The preferred method: Github Account**   
You are able to create a github account and submit bug reports at the top of the page under "Issues". This has a couple benefits

- You are able to actively participate in the troubleshooting process   
- You will be notified when someone responds to the report and can easily respond to additional requests   

~~**2. Secondary method: Email**~~ `NO LONGER VALID`  
~~There is an email you can send information to and it will automatically create a bug report without the need to create a github account. Unfortunately since this method forgoes the normal reporting process, you will miss out on the above points for using a github account. In addition, this is entirely anonymous so we have no way of figuring out who sent this information for a follow up.~~
~~- **Email:** foundabug@swequestrian.com~~

~~When submitting an email, the issue title will be the subject of the email and the body will be the details in the actual issue.~~
